# Left1dead TP_version

  You are playing as a hero who has risen against an intimidating horde of zombies, thereby your aim is to crush them while remaining alive:) 
The control is quite simple: you are able to move using keys Left and Right, jump within Up key and shoot your foes down with Down key. 
Good luck! It will certainly help you:)

There are 4 zombies you will have to fight to.

Usual zombie - just ont bullet needed to kill him (her, haha).
Fast zombie - as usual, but faster
cloning zombie - little zombie. Jumps. Makes his own copy every 2-3 seconds. Keep an eye on him (them, haha)
Boss zombie - large zombie with a lot of hp (10, haha). Produces fast zombies.
